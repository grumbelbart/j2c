Introduction
--
J2C will convert Java code into hopefully compilable C++ code. It works on
source level, translating Java source code constructs into their rough
equivalents in C++ . The output will be reasonably valid C++ code that looks a
lot like its Java counterpart and hopefully works mostly the same.

Download
--
The most recent version of the project is available as source code. You can get it
either from Eclipse labs (https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/j2c/) or
github (https://github.com/arnetheduck/j2c).

From time to time, a release may appear at the Eclipse labs site - see
https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/j2c/downloads/list .

Status
--
This project is an idea I've been wanting to try out written down in code.
Think of it as a paper napkin with some notes on, but in this case, the notes
compile and sometimes spit out working stuff. In other words, no guarantees 
and no quality control label.

This is also the first time I write an Eclipse plugin, so be nice.

That said, j2c successfully converts most of SWT to C++ that compiles and
passes a quick ocular inspection. Java 1.4 is mostly covered, as are parts
of 1.5+. 

Running
--
J2C comes in the form of an Eclipse plugin. If you used the zip, install it
as you normally would.
If you downloaded the source code you'll have run the plugin by opening the 
project in Eclipse and starting a new Eclipse test instance by using the run
button in the plugin.xml overview.

Once you have the plugin running, set up your Java code as an Eclipse Java
Project. Eclipse must be able to compile your code for J2C do to its work!

Once the Java Project is set up (with all dependencies etc), you can run J2C by
right-clicking the project and choosing the Translate to C++ option.

Testing
--
The test project contains a few cases which should be handled correctly by the
translator (by correctly, I mean that they compile with g++ 4.6). You'll find
a CDT project in ctest that builds using the generated Makefile after running
the plugin on the test project.

Output
--
For each Java class, j2c will output a header file and its implementation.
Inner classes end up in separate .h/.cpp pairs. Classes for which there is
no source will have a header written as well as a stub file with empty
implementations. Throughout, the heap will be used to allocate class instances
but no attempt is made to collect garbage.

Helping out
--
Patches and forks are most welcome, as is testing, but please report issues
unless you also attach a simple test case.

Licensing
--
The project is licensed under the Eclipse Public License 1.0.

No animals were hurt while writing this code, but the Nightwatchman
might have sore fingers and throat from all that playing...

Have fun,
